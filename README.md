# Expense Planner - Design Document

## Introduction
Our application is a web-based Expenses Planner that allows individuals to track and plan their spending in one place. The target users are those who struggle to keep track of all the bills they have to pay and save money more consistently. The system will allow the users to record their income and expenses, group transactions into different categories (such as rent, food, utilities, and subscriptions), and use a budgeting feature to see how much money they have left over to spend in each category for the month.
